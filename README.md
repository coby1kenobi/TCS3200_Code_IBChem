# IBChemAA-M21-
This is the code I'm using for my Arduino and the Processing environment which is in Java.

For my chemistry alternative experiment, I'm measuring the rate at which food coloring (blue) decreases when it is added to bleach for different concentrations. I am using a TSC2300 Module that senses the red, blue, and green values. Since I am only measuring the blue value, I am only outputting the blue values on my serial monitor. 

Processing 3.x.x is used to process data into a .csv file which can be opened in Excel to study the data and create graphs. The code is also here for that.
